<h1><u>History of Computers and the Internet</u></h1>

<hr>

<h2><mark>Early Computers</mark></h2>
<p>
  The <b>history</b> of computers dates back to the <i>early mechanical devices</i> like the <strong>abacus</strong>. 
  Charles Babbage, often called the <em>father of computing</em>, designed the Analytical Engine in the 1830s. 
  <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> concepts began forming during this era. 
  These machines were <small>massive</small> and <del>not very efficient</del><ins>limited in capability</ins>. 
  The evolution from vacuum tubes to transistors marked a <u>major shift</u> in computing. 
  Mathematically, the energy-mass equivalence formula <code>E = mc<sup>2</sup></code> inspired computational physics. 
  Early computers used punch cards and <kbd>binary input</kbd> to process data. 
  <q>The computer was born to solve problems that did not exist before.</q>

<h2><mark>Generations of Computers</mark></h2>
<p>
  Computers evolved through <strong>five generations</strong>. The first used <b>vacuum tubes</b>, the second <i>transistors</i>, 
  and the third introduced <em>integrated circuits</em>. The fourth generation brought <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> 
  and graphical interfaces. The fifth generation focuses on <u>artificial intelligence</u> and <code>machine learning</code>. 
  Each generation improved <small>speed</small>, <strong>efficiency</strong>, and <em>user experience</em>. 
  The formula for Ohm’s Law is <var>V</var> = <var>I</var><var>R</var>, where <var>V</var> is voltage, <var>I</var> is current, and <var>R</var> is resistance. 
  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Del</kbd> became iconic for rebooting systems.

<h2><mark>Birth of the Internet</mark></h2>
<p>
  The <strong>Internet</strong> began as ARPANET in the late 1960s. It was a <em>military project</em> that evolved into a global network. 
  The <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. 
  <cite>The Architecture of the World Wide Web</cite> laid the foundation for modern browsing.

    “Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.” — Steve Jobs
  </blockquote>
  The <code>TCP/IP</code> protocol enabled reliable communication. 
  <del>Dial-up</del><ins>Broadband</ins> connections revolutionized access. 
  The equation for bandwidth is <code>B = log<sub>2</sub>(1 + S/N)</code>, where <code>S/N</code> is the signal-to-noise ratio. 
  <kbd>ping</kbd> and <kbd>tracert</kbd> became essential diagnostic tools.

<h2><mark>Modern Era</mark></h2>
<p>
  Today’s computers are <strong>ubiquitous</strong> and <em>powerful</em>. Smartphones, tablets, and cloud computing dominate the landscape. 
  <abbr title="Graphical Processing Unit">GPU</abbr> technology supports gaming and AI. 
  <code>Python</code> and <code>JavaScript</code> are popular programming languages. 
  The formula for exponential growth is <code>A = P(1 + r)<sup>n</sup></code>. 
  <kbd>npm install</kbd> and <kbd>git commit</kbd> are common developer commands. 
  <samp>Installation complete</samp>. 
  <del>Local storage</del><ins>Cloud storage</ins> is now the norm. 
  <q>Computers are incredibly fast, accurate, and stupid.</q>

<h2><mark>Sample Code</mark></h2>
<pre><code>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  This simple <code>C</code> program prints <samp>Hello, World!</samp> to the console. 
  It uses the <kbd>printf</kbd> function and returns <code>0</code> to indicate success. 
  <em>Code readability</em> and <strong>efficiency</strong> are key in modern development. 
  <del>Spaghetti code</del><ins>Modular design</ins> is preferred. 
  <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr> tools like VS Code enhance productivity.
