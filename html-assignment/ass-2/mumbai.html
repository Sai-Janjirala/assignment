    <h1>Mumbai</h1>

    <p>My journey to Mumbai was nothing short of unforgettable. From the moment I stepped into the bustling streets, the city's energy swept me away. I explored iconic spots like Marine Drive and Gateway of India, soaking in the coastal charm and vibrant culture. The food was a highlight—every bite of vada pav and pav bhaji felt like a celebration. I met incredible people, each with stories that added depth to my experience. Whether it was navigating local trains or watching the sunset at Juhu Beach, every moment felt alive. Mumbai taught me resilience, warmth, and the beauty of chaos. It wasn't just a trip—it was a feeling I'll carry with me.</p>
