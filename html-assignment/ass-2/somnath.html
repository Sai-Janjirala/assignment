    <h1>Somanth Mahadev Temple</h1>

    <p>This is incredibile feeling of the temple that I had ever felt. It's the best feeling of my life. When I visited Somnath with my family we first went to Temple and bowed down there. Thanafter we had seen a show of the temples's history in which we got to know that the temple is being destroyed 4 or more than 4 times by Mughals and than finally after independence it is being rebuilt in 1951 by Shri Sardar Vallabhai Patel. There I had seen the dangerous look of sea. The waves there are so huge and even the voice of the voice that are being collinding with the wall that is made for protection is enough to make someone scared. But above all of this the energy or the aura of Lord Mahadev is of next level that I had ever felt. And I will remember this Energy for my whole life.</p>
